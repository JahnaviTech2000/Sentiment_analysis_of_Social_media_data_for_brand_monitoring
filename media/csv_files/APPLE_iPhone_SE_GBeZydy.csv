5,Classy product,This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I‚Äôve been a long time android user in between. I‚Äôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...READ MORE
4,Love at First Home Touch,"Totally worth the price if:- you are a iOS fan- like compact phone- want to switch from android to iPhone- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (yo...READ MORE"
4,Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.READ MORE

4,Very Good,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.READ MORE"
3,Iphone SE Budgeted Phone of 2020?,"I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows* Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.              2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.              3) Touch sensor works very precisely              4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry           ...READ MORE"
5,Brilliant,"People talk about it‚Äôs battery backup?? man I‚Äôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you‚Äôve used both you‚Äôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.READ MORE"
4,Wonderful,"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you...READ MORE"
4,Value-for-money,"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest.READ MORE"
4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE"

1,Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm not sure about regular battery consumption rate.

5,Just wow!,"Small yet powerful phone. I am posting this review after nearly 1 month of usage.1. Performance of the phone is awesome. There is no lag experienced in using any application, games, etc.2. Battery of the phone is good. It easily lasts 1 day with full day usage of internet like mails, apps, photos, surfing, etc and calling also. This phone is for moderate phone users not gamers ( from battery point of view) .

It is super fast‚úåÔ∏è.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo fr...READ MORE"

5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with...READ MORE"
5,Just wow!,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand.

I am a big fan of iOS and I‚Äôm deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I‚Äôm not disappointed here too.

5,Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable.  The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my ...READ MORE"

5,Brilliant,For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean  top notch performance ......FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch .

5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

3,Just okay,"The phone is great and has snappy performance. Ofcourse iOS in itself is one of the most refined OS in the world(Android has too much fragmentation, app developers cant keep up, also Android Auto is super laggy too). Apple CarPlay works like a charm in my car. For anyone wanting to try an iPhone this is a great entry level phone.Yes there are downsides to this phone. Namely screen and battery.

5,A ideal upgrade for iPhone6s and its predecessors,"Would recommend this mobile if you are the one who doesn't play many games, uses mobile for surfing/social media and occasionally for photography. Would not recommend if you are into huge screens and brighter displays. To sum up, iPhone SE is a 'no-nonsense mobile' with an average camera and battery life. Also highlighting its significance, I can say it is DAMN FAST, you will be amazed by its speed and fluidity which makes it worthy enough for the money.READ MORE"

Features are great. Battery is issue. It won‚Äôt last you whole day if your a heavy user. Expect 5 hours of screen time of your heavy user. Otherwise overall good value for money.READ MORE

3,Fair,"Ahhh where to start.!!, yes simple and daily usage mobile, one day battery life for normal usage. Great performance with A13 Bionic chip.

5,Simply awesome,"Just wow. This phone‚Äôs a breeze. The apple ecosystem is obviously extraordinary and with the phone‚Äôs chip and ram management one wouldn‚Äôt have no lag whatsoever.

3,Fair,I edited this just after 3 months of use that the battery is so so bad that i had to refill it atleast twice a day and it takes more than 2 hours to refill. This mobile was great in terms of performance and camera but lacks a little bit on the design and battery. The design was bit outdated and the mobile takes more than 2 hours to refill. The IOS experience was great but i do prefer the android experience which is free and have more variety in it. In this price range the only competitors are...READ MORE

5,Simply awesome,"I was an Android user and this is the first iPhone I‚Äôve ever used. This phone has the best 4g processor, the thing that makes your phone last longer. The camera is decent with better pictures in day light when compared to night photos. The battery is of less capacity but if you are a light to average user, you can breeze through your day. A big NO if you are a gamer though.READ MORE"
3,Does the job,If a phone with 4 hours screen on time does not sound exciting then I'd say skip the phone. You'd have to charge this phone twice a day for normal use. Rest it's snappy and has a good camera.READ MORE

Good for photography but excellent for videography* Smooth display. It is only LCD display but far better than android phones LCD displays* Wireless ...READ MORE

On one hand we have the best in class A13 bionic processor and on the other hand the best mobile operating system ever. With the privacy features but into iOS 14 it i THE PHONE to own in these times. The camera also never disappoints as it takes amazing pictures without you even thinking about the exposure.

5,Highly recommended,Battery is a not great and not for a person who can‚Äôt charge this phone for 2 times a day. And gamers I would suggest u this phone only if u can keep it on charge when not gaming. Overall performance beast. PUBG is as smooth as butter. Didn‚Äôt get any single frame drop when 4 squad hotdrop Ace tier. Camera is really good. U would be happy on your clicks during daytime or on strong artificial light but obviously not at night. Worth the money coz 4-5 years of software update is really awesome.READ MORE

5,Fabulous!,The rumors about this phone of its low battery backup are fake. It provides the best battery backup and lasts a full day with light use like Instagram and WhatsApp. The performance of this phone is the best compared to android phones at this price range. And with the iOS 14 update the iPhone SE is the star of the show . And there are no such noticable differences between the SE and the 12READ MORE
2,Moderate,Only good thing about this phone is its processor.What is the use of good processor if you ve average camera below average screen size. I ve not udapted to new software but the UI is not that friendly with the present software version. You ll get very good Android phone for the same price. Or if you can shell out extra bucks then go for higher version of iPhone. This is not worth it.READ MORE

3,1 week user,"The product is great in itself, other than the battery. I have a 2016 iPhone 6 and the battery life if pretty similar to that. Really hoping that Apple does something about the battery life in coming update. Other than that everything is great and it delivers what you're promised. A-13 bionic chip will amaze you with the speed and camera is great, specially for the price. Great phone, just be aware that you'll have to charge it multiple times a day, so don't forget to carry a power bank!READ MORE"
5,Great product,Best in the market Seriously no android phone can compete with this 4.7 inch beast performing device. A13 Bionic is far more superior than Snapdragon 865. I am an hardcore android guy & I am giving my genuine review after 4 days of extensive IOS usageREAD MORE
4,Really Nice,The iPhone SE 2020 is a real value for money mobile device. It has got the latest processor (A13 Bionic Chip) which is said to be the fastest processor that is present in the current market. The camera is a real catch having support for high definition video and photos that can be shot in portrait mode which adds a certain depth to the photos. The 4.7 inch screen is a real compact and comfy size for those who do not prefer large phone sizes. The battery life is great as well. All in all the i...READ MORE
2,Expected a better product,"It's an outdated very very tiny phone, with a very poor battery life for a tiny phone. Only thing that's good is maybe the camera which again is useless in low light.Even the Netflix movies don't appear in full screen, imagine having a top and bottom bar while viewing movies on netflix on such a tiny phone. The front facing ear speaker too fades away and becomes in audible in just 2 months despite cleaning it with rubbing alcohol.

5,Brilliant,It's too powerful to use. The only problem is its size and its battery. But I should tell you that if you are going to buy this phone for gaming purpose you should buy oneplus Nord. As it has the same price and a bigger battery and a display too. This phone heats too much when you play game. You dont get a night mode in the camera but if you focus on an item and then increase the exposure you will get satisfactory photo in night.

5,Terrific,"This is the phone to get if you just want a new iPhone that will last you a few years, but don‚Äôt want to pay a lot for it. The iPhone SE 2020 offers ‚Äòdecent but not top-end‚Äô performance: a good camera, enough power, a great App Store to plunder and a lighter iPhone than recent models. Battery life and screen tech could be better, the headphone jack is a miss, but - for the price - this is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made.READ MORE"

4,Excellent phone with okay battery.,"I bought this phone for two reasons. First I wanted something small, and it's so hard to find any decent phones that are pocketable.

It's also very well built and blazingly fast, so I'm sure with proper care it should last a long time.On the negative side, the battery life is poor. I'm ...READ MORE"

But you can never say that the display is poor. I even find it better than some of the amoled displays on mid range redmi and realme phones. But on full brightness you can feel...READ MORE

This is much more value for money than iPhone 11 because there is a 20000+ price difference for very few features. This can do almost everything the same and it's the cheapest and best option to get into the iOS environment.If you have a budget for a phone, the iPhone SE is definitely a top choice. It's much better ...READ MORE"
