"Anonymous, 01 Mar 2021I would think that those first 2 issues are what makes it not  a 'Great UI'.
If it&... moreWhat makes it an great UI you ask me? Plenty of reasons, like :
 
1. Animations and transitions in every tap, swipe, scroll gesture you make. It is very good in 90/120hz displays. You simply just notice it the difference between 90 and 60hz. Whereas stock android and oxygenos doesn't have those animations, so high refresh rates doesn't look as good as MIUI.
 
2. Plenty of customization, you can change icons, super wallpapers, themes, lock, charging/fingerprint animation
 
3. Just like the first point, every actiom you do will have an haptic feedback, yes even cheap phones from Xiaomi do. So even if the feedback isn't as good, it is still better than not getting an feedback. In Xiaomi Flagships, the feedback for every action you do even outclasses Apple's Taptic engine and Ios.
 
4. Promised Updates for at least 3 generations of MIUI (not android) no matter what phones you choose, cheap or super cheap. I mean, even Redmi Note 7 , which ships with Android 9, gets Android 11 and 3 versions of MIUI, sure you will not get Android 12, but you will later get MIUI 12.5 which is better than Oneplus giving only 1 years of updates. Even though the update is a bit slow, but still better than not getting updates. Even Realme, Oneplus, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Samsung entry level phones only gets one year updates.
 
4. Plenty of featues, like scollshot, screen recorder, DC dimming, vibration customization, clear speaker, and even fun ones, like an app exploding in your home screen when you delete it. 
 
5. Extreme levels of details just like Point 1 and 3. There's just so much attention to details. But at cheaper phones, this skin may be a bit too heavy for them. While on high end xiaomi phones, the UI is so awesome and also without ads (which i don't mind). The scanner app i also found it to be able to be deactivated, but i just let it on so it can continue to scan my apps from unknown sources or play store.
 
I am not an Xiaomi fanboy, i just like what i think are the best parts. And the positives of MIUI overshadows the negatives of it. Not like Huawei's EMUI and Vivo's Funtouch OS"

The common buyers know that Samsung and Apple phones are not designed for gaming, but that doesn’t mean there should be a huge performance gap between better performing phones using an identical or same level chipset, unless we’re talking about dedicated gaming phones.
 
Golden Reviewer videos are already debunked as a fraud, at least by Gary Explains from Android Authority. That guy is not running the phones in ideal conditions no matter if he bought the phones with his money, even MrWhoseTheBoss which is not exactly reliable purchases almost all phones but OnePlus with his revenue. Only his SPECint videos can be trusted.

I have played the game since the second week of launch. At version 1.0, there were not much issues with the game. My Samsung used to run at high (not highest) settings 30 frames without frame drops, at least for half an hour gameplay. There were not many bugs to start with. Same applies for my iPhone 11 where it can run at the highest, 30 despite getting very warm (because it lacks cooling). The iPhone 12 clearly had OS issues initially and hence the throttling, where many games would just stutter here and there.
 
Only then after 1.2 (Dragonspine map update) I have noticed that the game does not run normally as usual in any of my phones. Don't blame the lack of cooling, because I visited the Genshin forums in Facebook and also noticed many players having the same issue. It used to be that players with lower end chipset/phones (ex. Redmi Note 8 w/ SD 665) were able to play the game, nowadays it will just glitch and get very hot when their device specs meets the requirements. This is not fixed in 1.3.
 
I don't get the reason why you bought a Samsung S21 Ultra if you are only planning to play that single game, if you are not even a frequent gamer. Yes I am aware of the video recording issues. Don't think the SD version of the S21 Ultra is going to perform a lot better aside from cameras, just try it.

Samsung Exynos and Apple A14 clearly throttling because of lack of adequate cooling. 
COD and Pub G aren't that demanding as Genshin Impact. 
 
""Also no point of selling a S21 Ultra only because of that single game. You can’t be serious at all. Then what phone did you switch to?"" 
 
If Snapdragon 865 can perform better than Exynos 2100 because of Exynos gpu throttling, then I don't feel worth spending on a Exynos model. I'll happily wait for some Snapdragon 888 device. I also mentioned how video recording was terrible for whatever reasons and photo quality inferior in many cases to my wife's mi 10 ultra. Add to that slow battery charging times, I just didn't feel justified in giving €1250 to Samsung for that, consequently returned the phone.  
I am still currently on my previous Samsung Galaxy flagship. After the good reviews of MI 11,  I am waiting for Mi 11 pro or the MI 11 Ultra. 
 
""Still not answering my question which adventure rank are you and the characters you own so at least I can verify the validity of your statement."" 
 
I already told you that I am not much of a gamer, let alone playing Genshin Impact regularly. I just fired up the game on the new device since it is the most demanding title on playstore. Was excited to see how Exynos 2100 handles the most demanding game on playstore. Was dissapointed. If I am buying a flagship, I expect a flagship. People like you can be okay with compromises which is why you love the iPhone so much, I don't need to make those compromises son. "

It’s due to poor optimisation of the game that causes the Samsung to have issues. I am a member of some Genshin groups, just check players complaining despite having a high end device. Almost all phones but those from Xiaomi (even a phone like Realme X50 Pro has issues and not all Mi phones) has issues. Then why is mine having a screen glitch? It’s obvious that the developers do not support the graphics.
 
I have decided to test the phone in other demanding games, or older titles but at highest settings. PUBG and COD Mobile will run at highest settings locked at 60 frames without any heat build up. Bright Memory Mobile does not have issues as well. Shadowgun Legends, which is very demanding, also runs well most of the time. Only few frame dips but mostly smooth overall.
 
If a game does not run well on a phone you cannot say that game is demanding. Think of Cyberpunk 2077. That game has good visuals and is requires high specs. Unfortunately this game is buggy here and there including graphics. This is why many people do not benchmark PC with this game and use something else more highly optimised, ex. Shadow of the Tomb Raider (very popular).
 
I also checked Gary Explains video about the A14 throttling test and the A14 almost doesn’t throttle whereas last iPhone 11 Pro Max with A13 throttles 15%. Last 2 years I have complained about the Speed Test G being biased but some people in GsmA insisted to me. Now that the iPhone leads they now blame the benchmark. Silly, as soon as an iPhone leads in anything they call it a biased test. 😀 I have checked other videos in that channel and most of them are very reliable.
 
Also no point of selling a S21 Ultra only because of that single game. You can’t be serious at all. Then what phone did you switch to? Still not answering my question which adventure rank are you and the characters you own so at least I can verify the validity of your statement."
Hey Xiaomi shut up & release the Mi Mix Alpha. 😡😡😡😡
"MrDong, 18 Feb 2021Sounds like you watch Golden Reviewer Youtube videos and literally takes anything he finds to ... moreI tested the phone myself. I don't play games much. Decided to run Genshin Impact since it is one of the most demanding titles. Exynos 2100 being a flagship chip should run it fine. Got 30-35fps at certain stages of the game and was dissapointed. Ran the same game on my wife's mi 10 ultra, it was getting 55fps and above average. Next gen chip shouldn't be struggling compared to the Snapdragon 865. Then looked up online and found that Snapdragon 888 has much better performance. Exynos scr€wed up again. The video recording was also terrible for whatever reasons. I have used Samsung flagships in the past exclusively, Samsung used to be the best at video recording. For whatever reasons, they couldn't optimize it on their own homegrown chip this year. I expected more from a phone that cost me €1250. Returned it and now I am waiting to buy something with the Snapdragon 888.
 
""My phone is using Snapdragon 865 and not Exynos 990.""
 
Read my post again, I said Galaxy S20 FE 5g. The 5g is exclusive to Snapdragon version.  
The reason why your Galaxy S20 FE with Snapdragon 865 gave low fps is because Samsung doesn't put any cooling on it. The chip is capable to give solid 60fps. They have to pair it with proper cooling. Same for the A14, it drops to 45fps average because of lack of cooling. If Apple implemented proper cooling, it would have maintained 60fps,but it doesn't in real life. 
 
Who cares about Gary Sims or some benchmark? The phone is behind in fps. 
I gave the example of wildfire benchmark to demonstrate how these benchmarks mean nothing and despite IPhone beating every other chip in benchmarks, it is struggling to go beyond 45fps because of thermal throttling. Why is there thermal throttling you ask? Because they cheapened out on the cooling. Wow what a premium brand!!!
 
""I remembered the statement that you hyped the S21 Ultra so much just because it was rumoured to score 800k in Antutu"" 
 
Well I was hyped up for the Exynos 2100 chip. It should have scored 800k as Snapdragon 888 is already scoring 740k. Unfortunately, Samsung dissapointed again this year.

But you know what I found it really ironic? The Sony Xperia 1 ii, with a much smaller 4,000mAh battery and a full-on 4K screen with a static 60Hz screen refresh rate, managed to score just about the same endurance battery life as the Mi 11 also in 60Hz screen refresh rate mode. It does make me wonder if there is a battery optimization issue going on either from the chipset or from the MIUI or from both of them. For a phone with a QHD+ display and a large battery not going way further than a phone with a 4K display and a small battery, there is definitely a problem going on here. "

Now they are doing again.  Removing sd card and headphone jack. No accessories in the box they sell for more than $35 (the 25W charger) and pack it inside a huge box, huge enough you can have an ipad pro inside.

I used Galaxy S21 with Exynos 2100 and it was giving 30-35fps at certain stages of the game. Returned it. 
 
The game is more optimized for smartphones over consoles or PC. If it was that badly optimized, Snapdragon 865 phones wouldn't be getting above 50fps consistently, ROG 3 like this anonymous guy mentioned gets 58fps with last year's chip(because Asus didn't cheapen out on cooling like Apple) 
 
The A14 scores some 7k points in Wildfire and gets 46fps while Snapdragon 888 scores around 5.5k in that same benchmark and gets 33 fps. 
But these are benchmarks scores. In the real world, A14 gets 60fps only in first five minutes, after that it throttles down to 45fps with latest iOS. The Snapdragon 888 scores 55fps and above average frame rate. The iOS 14.4 update didn't do jack sh*t. No software updates or optimization will fix lack of cooling. "

"""108MP sensor is more than enough for smart/magic zoom ala Pixel 5,"" 
The Pixel 5 has no magic zoom. All people who praise Google's zoom obviously never compared the zoom in a scientific way. I have Google phones and I know what I am talking about. In perfect light conditions without shadows Google's zoom has basically no advantage over conventional digital zoom or crop of a dng file. Whenever there is an advantage over a crop, it's due to the fact that Google combines more frames when you zoom, this leads to less noise and more detail in low light conditions, but doesn't work in good light conditions, no matter what Google said. Google's machine learning zoom also invents wrong detail, so it can actually perform worse than conventional digital zoom."
