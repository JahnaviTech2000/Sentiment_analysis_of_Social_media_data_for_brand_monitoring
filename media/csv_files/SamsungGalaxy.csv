"""The Always On Display also works at 60Hz - we expected this to be the place where we'd see the promised 10Hz. Well, it is not. This could be a potential burn-in-related setting, though, which mandates refreshing those pixels every now and then.""
 
Why would I want 120Hz from AOD? It's only there to display notifications. I don't even slightly care about having ""smoother"" scrolling. I care a lot more about the content inside the app itself. HRR screens only pay dividends in gaming, that's it! You can't change that fact."

"i wish they actually would stop using the 108mp sensor, in exchange for a much more usable 50mp sensor, however, since numbers can fool people, they'll keep increasing to numbers up to 1 gigapixel with some 100-in-1 pixel binning for 10mp image.
 
it's honestly pathetic that samsung keeps wanting to push the megapixel race, in exchange for only 12mp. (apple started this in 2015 with their 6s having 12mp, then after 2015, samsung copied apple with 12mp sensors up until to sony making a quad-bayer sensor for 12mp output, then samsung scammed people with 108mp number that only outputs 12mp. )
 
i don't get it. 
make a real 33mp or 40mp rgb bayer sensor with a big size for 8k recording, and a software with an option to output 20 or 25mp by downscaling the 33/40mp image to that resolution instead.
 
it had me expecting a lot on quad-bayers, 
so far the best quad-bayer/terapixel rn is the samsung isocell hmx, even though the 108mp number is a gimmick, it still gives me a lot of hope because it outputs 27mp which is quite a lot, and better than the ""industry standard"" 12mp."

2) If apple is eating shit, Samsung doesn't need to eat that shit by copying that and being a tail of apple. If you want to compete with apple then compete in good things like there software support, customer support etc instead of gimmicking people. 
3) Removing charger brick on the name of saving climate is like ... as if we all are fool and don't understand that Samsung wants to mint more profit out of each sale. Instead remove the unnecessary paper work and provide longer software support to its customers so that they can hold these phones for more number of years and reduce the pollution per head.

"TheLastOracle, 28 Jan 2021BM3D technique is basically a image denoising algorithm, and nothing more. And, incidentally, ... moreHuawei clearly stated during the Kirin 990 announcement that its ISP uses BM3D NR to handle noise in still images, and if you do a bit of research you'll find out that this very algorithm is indeed developed by University of Tampere and Huawei - which explains why no smartphone/camera manufactures but only they managed to implement it on their products. Have Qualcomm or Samsung stated anywhere that they use the same algorithm on their flagship SoCs? If you know then please kindly quote.
 
It's also worth mentioning that BM3D NR has some interesting characteristics - Noises in low frequency areas of an image are swept away whereas textures and lines are selectively preserved instead of turned into an oilpainting - which Mate exactly shows in its image. On the other hand, S21U still leaves a bit of noise in smooth/immacurate sections in the frame while losing some details (See the fish on the lower right corner).

Samsung, as always, applies too much sharpening to its image resulting in this odd ""whitening"" of edges as well as some discolourations in finer textures. Pit it against Find X2 Pro and Mate 30 Pro and you'll see what I mean - they all capture comparable amount of details yet photos from both X2 Pro and Mate look softer, more natural (especially in small lines/texts) with less obvious edge enhancement artifacts.
 
Here are some simple steps to create ringing around edges in your photos: 
1. Select any image (including RAW) and import it to Lightroom. 
2. Take the sharpening slider all the way up to the right and use the largest sharpening radius settings. 
3. You should see white borders on high contrast edges. "

To GSM Arena team - You may want to update specification page, as it's written on Corning site that both back and front of S21 Ultra is made of Victus glass (you can check this info here - https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra.html) 
 
I'm quite surprised how little improvements in main camera has been made for all these years, just check S9+ images vs S21 ultra: 
S9+: https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/reviews/18/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus/camera/gsmarena_030.jpg

You see better dynamic range, and some minor improvements here and there, but nothing like ""day and night"" difference.
 
The only reason (for me) upgrading my ancient old S9 to S21 Ultra is getting latest Android 11. Other than that, aside from zooming capabilities I'm really not keen to make a switch.

I actually see better photo quality with the S20 Ultra. The only consolation I will give is the S21 Ultra's native 3x telephoto camera. It does produce a much better 3x zoom photo than the S21's 3x crop zoom camera.
 
It's a totally different story for lowlight though. While there is some sharpening involved, it's not as severe as in daylight condition. Even the noise is gone as well. It seems that the updated sensor's Nona Bayer filter modifications algorithm now pays off in low light. It is much better than both the S21 and also the S20 Ultra."

They keep on leaving features... no microsd, no irda, no audio jack, no removable battery, now no charger (!). And devices still cost an eye"
"Alex, 26 Jan 2021And even Arena points that ""almost as if the camera was not stabilized"". Samsung see... moreTo make photo brighter.  
A very weird fetish ppl have today. 
 
They want very dark places to be bright as if you had lighting around, like photographers bring sometimes. "
"And even Arena points that ""almost as if the camera was not stabilized"". Samsung seems to be utilizing the worst (""cheapest"") OIS hardware out there. I noticed that difference between my S10 and S9: for the same light conditions S10 gives larger ISO/exposure."
"Anonymous, 25 Jan 2021So, main camera is 26mm and periscope is 240mm.
But Samsung advertises as 10x. Again fooling ... moreThe main camera is equivalent to 24mm. But it's actually not really a ""10x optical zoom"" setting, because 10x optical zoom means that the focal length is 10x as high. Only then the physical magnification is 10 times as large as the magnification of the main camera. But the focal length of the periscope camera is 30.6mm whereas the main camera has 6.7mm. So the magnification is actually only 4.6 times as large. That's the reason why it needs to use a smaller sensor than the main camera. A true optical zoom setting decreases neither the sensor size nor the megapixel count. (Though in this case, due to diffraction, only the 3x camera would have benefited from a higher megapixel count).
 
Recently, a website has shown a raw file comparison in low light conditions with the S20 Ultra (not S21 Ultra) and has uploaded the dng files. It seems that 108 to 12 megapixel pixel binning doesn't work perfectly. Despite a noticeably longer exposure time, the 12 megapixel raw file didn't really look better than the raw file of a Xiaomi 10 Ultra, this means that the 10 Ultra should produce less noisy raw files in extremely low light conditions at the same exposure time. Also a OnePlus 8 Pro produced a noticeably less noisy dng file (than the S20 Ultra) with a similar exposure time. The worst raw file was from Huawei, who doesn't offer pixel binning raw files."
"Alex, 26 Jan 2021So the Preview turned out to be true: image quality is terrible. Main cam pulls it out somehow... moreAnd horrible low light main cam performance is just a reminder how useless those 64MP and 108MP gimmicks are. Every engineer will tell you that one big pixel captures light way more accurately than 4 small ones. But no, companies keep releasing 108MP monsters - for those users who judge phones by the specs."
"So the Preview turned out to be true: image quality is terrible. Main cam pulls it out somehow during the day (with softness on the edges), but turns ugly at night as any other camera in this phone. The only difference with other cameras is that they suk big time during the day too: details and texture are all washed out. 
Exynos 2100 seem to be the main (only?) advantage of this year's model: got some performance gain together with the lower power consumption, that's a relief for Exynos region."
"Don't want to ruin the party but benchmarks are now  
released and the Exynos variant is still ~15% slower  
than its Snapdragon sibling.
 
657k on antutu ? Last year's Mi10 Ultra (S865) was good for 640k. 
On the other hand the MI11 (S888) released alongside the S21U is good for 710k.
 
Samsung keeps releasing two version of their flagships : 
One with current year performance, one with last year performance
 
And I'm not only talking about raw numbers, but also about battery life and photos quality which proved to be inferior on Exynos S20s.
 
And regarding gaming, The Mali GPU still is vastly inferior the to Adreno.  
A whole gen behind despite having more graphics cores.
 
Can you imagine Chevrolet selling only the Camaro V6  
in Europe and charging V8 money for it like it's just the same ?
 
Jeez

"
"""Night Mode works on the long-range tele, too. It helps to improve the exposure, but other than that - you won't get a better image than the standard mode."" 
The night mode sample images do look better, apart from double images."
"Congrats for the ones that will still buy this phone no matter what. For me since i won't buy it i have to say that i don't understand how Samsung managed to use their latest tech and still not be able to offer something special or better than older phones did already in the market especially when it comes to main camera's output which is what i usually focus on.  
I also have to admit though that indeed in other reviews on youtube i noticed that the photos taken were looking better than what i saw in GSMARENA's review but still didn't get impressed anywhere so far.  
It's a pitty to see in general that newer flagships can't beat the older ones and even though i never bought an Iphone or Pixel device for me these two are the best phones and most balanced for taking photos.  
I've been using Xiaomi together with gcam for the past few years but i am tired of trying to find which gcam app is the best or which gcam developer is the best and has the latest version or which config is the best and bla bla bla. Hence my next option will be the upcoming Google Pixel flagship and end of the story. "
Too narow for the max model
"fruitcake, 25 Jan 2021Will be waiting for a Exynos review of this phone before,i decide to give it a chance,its only... moreThis review is exynos device.

"Anonymous, 25 Jan 2021So, main camera is 26mm and periscope is 240mm.
But Samsung advertises as 10x. Again fooling ... moreMain camera focal length on GSMarena is incorrect. It should be 24mm. In the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked Event, they stated right there @42m00s in the presentation. 

https://youtu.be/TD_BZN0bn_U?t=2520 
 
This is why 0.6x = 23mm, 3x = 72mm and 10x = 240mm"
"Will be waiting for a Exynos review of this phone before,i decide to give it a chance,its only January,so know Samsung trying to get buyers back,they might bring out a new version of this phone that offers the micro sd card slot,if the sales are bad,Samsung should have made these phones more affordable in Europe after what they did with the the S20 models and Rubbish Exynos chips,that they knew themselves was miles behind Snapdragon version"
"Another day, another overpriced Samsung crap with awful camera..."
"Gsmarena.com, you guys should get your phone (ultra) checked. Of all the Reviewers Online, your photos are the least impressive. The only issue most reviewers feel, that needs to be improved with software, is the level of noise in video, especially at night. Otherwise photos seem stellar in most conditions. "
"The Ultra is the most compelling one out of the S21's, and yet another review has mixed feelings about it. Samsung absolutely needs to add back MicroSD, MST, and a charger for the S22, and also stop segregating the phones and making the S21 and S21+ third class citizens using 1080p in 2021, even $400 phones with oled screens had 1440p! And this isnt about costing cutting, the S10 had all those features and cost less.
 
I am a samsung user, and will be getting an S21U but ONLY because trade in value/CB/accessories/etc make it so the transition from S20 to S21U is basically free. Otherwise I'd say the S21 and S20 base models are the worst Samsung has ever made in terms of price to features, while the S10 was a homerun."
"Anonymous, 25 Jan 2021It’s better device than S20 ultra in every way, but Samsung still made mistake by ditching 48M... moreEcho that, and not the fastest charging support. Not even near. Mi giving 125W charger, that's insane. And nore companies are putting faster chargers. Atleast try for 50-80w charger. Or maybe Sam has battery fear since note 7. "
GSM Arena nitpicking there's nothing wrong with these images they are great. And those night mode shots are superb 
"Note10PlusIsBoss, 25 Jan 2021Samsung should be ashamed of themselves ripping off customers with these useless offerings. No... moreBe sure that at this point, the project of upcoming phones are very advanced.  
When a product is announced, they are already working on the next generation. 
 
As far as I have read on twitter,  none of the expensive future Galaxies have sd slot. Also more phones (midranges) may lose charger and earphones . "
Is this review of the Exynos model or the Snapdragon model? Asking specifically out of curiosity about the battery review.
"Nice review GSMA!
 
I get the issue with standard low light shots and thankfully, it'll be improved with software updates.
 
However, on my S10, I rarely use auto mode in low light. I will always switch to night mode, as it does a great job for the photo's I like to take.
 
With that in mind, I am so excited to be receiving my S21 Ultra this week!"
"So, main camera is 26mm and periscope is 240mm. 
But Samsung advertises as 10x. Again fooling costumers. 
 
I know all phones lose performance as ISO goes high, but a 1/1.3"" has obligation to deal better with ISO1000.  Samsung and Apple have always been the weakest at high iso among expensive phones. 

"
"I am re-posting my own comment from the other thread. This is for Samsung to continue processing the photo, after it has been taken, to increase detail, dynamic range and sharpness via AI
 
""...  
Samsung should do what iPhones do with Zooming (they use a similar algorithm to Google's Super Zoom), and (Samsung should) Improve Details in the 108MP and even 12MP photos, which is, they use post processing to improve detail and sharpness even further. It's like built-in lines of the algorithms, which actually improve the resolution and detail in the final image, via AI, after the photo has been taken, thereby circumventing many of the limitations of the actual sensor, even beyond regular HDR image processing. This is the sharp contrast between the Viewfinder photo and the final taken one. That's why the final taken one, especially for zoom, in the iPhone us surprisingly good, even at 10x. 
 
SAMSUNG, YOU NEED TO DO THIS.""
"
"Anonymous, 25 Jan 2021It’s better device than S20 ultra in every way, but Samsung still made mistake by ditching 48M... moreTo enlarge the periscope from 104mm to 240mm, it is necessary to decrease sensor size.  
Otherwise, module would be way bigger. 

"
"Sadly it only comes  with the (yet again) inferior Exynos where I live. 
The exynos is still   a lower performance and battery , harsher  thermal throttling  than the Snapdragon, and what's more is still sold at an higher MSRP than the SD variant.
