My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone. Best features with stunning looks & performance. Battery life is very good...READ MORE"
This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I‚Äôve been a long time android user in between. I‚Äôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...READ MORE

Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.

"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.READ MORE"

"People talk about it‚Äôs battery backup?? man I‚Äôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you‚Äôve used both you‚Äôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.READ MORE"

"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE"

"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with...READ MORE"
"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand.

"I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me.READ MORE"
"Keeping it shortBest value for money, capeesh. Has its shortcomings battery(will get you 3.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time depending on the usage, gaming is wonderful but due to its small battery capacity it does depletes fast, roughly around 2 - 2.5 hours on screen time) and camera(night mode doesn‚Äôt support, although Apple can add it through software on due to its processing power but lack in a second camera don‚Äôt let it do so). Other then that trust me you will enjoy it and get its money‚Äô...READ MORE"
"The phone is all over amazing best for entering ios ecosystem the screen size is not as small as it may seem , the only problem i faced was battery life it could have been better but the powerful processor does demand a lot of battery , the images are unbeatable even by Android flagshipsREAD MORE"
"One word, Outstanding!I‚Äôve Samsung galaxy A70 and I turned off many of its services including animations so that it give me a all day battery life but this is not the case with this iPhone SE .It comes with just 1821 mah battery but trust me It gives 24hr battery backup which includes 4.5hr on screen time. Mostly I use my phone for WhatsApp, insta, news articles, YouTube music and puzzle games when I got time.It‚Äôs display is good, looks like OLED one (but it is not).READ MORE"
"This is my second iPhone and it‚Äôs pretty good, the performance is fast and never felt a lag. For my day-to-day usage it‚Äôs perfect, I have no complaints with the battery. The compact size makes it easier to use and for this budget it‚Äôs worth to go for unless want to shell out 2x the amount for 12 mini, which is a bit smaller than SE 2nd Generation; has better camera setup; better screen & better battery life.READ MORE"
"The best compact phone you can get along with fingerprint scanner.. The classic iphone design.. So clean and premium looks.. I guess the most premium looking classic iphone with a powerful flagship processor ( except the notched iphones X and beyond).. Go for it . You won't regret if you like small phones.. Feels great to hold and easy to use with one hand...

"The Phone makes it a good compact phone to kick start you ios Experience. This being my second iphone after the 6S+ and this phone just being my secondary phone it has the solid reliability which i want. The battery standby is good but if a person in considering to use this phone as a primary device the battery wont last for the full day sadly.

Everything seems fine with this phone but this is a super fast car but with a small gas tank the one and only con of this phone but if you are looking to buy this phone you know what you have signed up for but if you want to get a scoop of ios for the first this will be a perfect device to start with as it comes with the one of the best processor at an reasonable price tag my suggestion is that if you can compromise by charging your phone for 2 times a day you can easily go for itREAD MORE
Overall the phone is very good but the fact is that it is too small in comparison to phones now these days however the camera is very good and the processor is very powerful you can play any game in the in it. You should not consider buying this. Only con is that it is screen sizes too small.READ MORE

Almost it is a decent phone. It would have been better if there would have been a headphone jack and a strong battery.READ MORE
"I was looking for a compact and slim phone with a finger print sensor on the front. The design is dated, but the pros that I was looking for was all there. I love this form factor. What impressed me was the ease with which it multi tasks. I am a first time apple user and this kinda was a wake up call for me. The ui is good, the device is really fast and more importantly my office apps works like a charm (I struggled a bit with android before with the certificates). I feel it is worth the buy.READ MORE"
Trust your gut and buy this if you are not a heavy user battery is a little shaky specially not meant for gaming where a battery drops up to 10% after every PUBG or Fortnite match the phone and also day to day task very well. Supports fast charging which is a great feature if you buy a separate 18 W charger. Works great and handles every app very well still unfortunately there are very less apps that are supported by iOS and android.READ MORE

"Would recommend this mobile if you are the one who doesn't play many games, uses mobile for surfing/social media and occasionally for photography. Would not recommend if you are into huge screens and brighter displays. To sum up, iPhone SE is a 'no-nonsense mobile' with an average camera and battery life. Also highlighting its significance, I can say it is DAMN FAST, you will be amazed by its speed and fluidity which makes it worthy enough for the money.READ MORE"

"Absolute beast of a phone - compact, portable and with an amazing camera paired to stereo speakers! Battery life is sadly the major drawback of this phone and so not recommended for people who expect higher screen on time. I find it suitable for our mothers and fathers who want something portable and easy to use from day one! I also found outdoor brightness of the screen underwhelming, struggling to read outdoors. But the phone makes up for its drawbacks for features such as: water and dust r...READ MORE"
"A perfect blend of nostalgia, perfect size and ergonomics combined with super top of the line specs but with some back dates stuff !Overall, a value for money Apple phone which will last you another 3-4 years, maybe more and will never let you down.

Phone is good if ypu wish t ahift drom android and want a decent camera in your pocket. Defenetly not for gamers because processor Bionic A13 can take nay game with full graphics no prob but battery will disappoint you. Not for long video calls rest things are fine premium feel full display could have been better. If battery and display is also important ro you consider XR or 11.READ MORE
"Package is well packed . Got this phone in first sale itself and it's been 3 weeks . Performance is snappy and camera is pretty good. The only con is Battery life which barely lasts full day with moderate to heavy usage, but it is expected because of it's compact and light weight design. Other than that phone is good and price should be at least 10k cheaper then only price to performance ratio can be justifiedREAD MORE"
I love this product and thanks to flipkart for a quick delivery that I didn‚Äôt expect that I got it before the delivery date that mention in the order list and i thank you to the delivery man that he took patience to wait till I paid the bill for this order. Once again thank you so much.READ MORE

"The phone works just fine! Despite the negativity around the battery life (which is true, only if you want to want to play games).Camera is nice, display with True Tone feels just right and the performance is spectacular! After 3 years with Android (Google Pixel 2 XL) it was time to head back to iOS. Nothing against Android, that was a brilliant phone too, but too big for me. (Personal choice). I don‚Äôt play games or watch movies/videos for prolonged duration. So a big screen just felt like ...READ MORE"
Performance is awesome with A13 bionic chipThose who capture a lot of pics it‚Äôs a very good choice fir them... single camera but picture quality is giant....Battery performance is little bit of weak.. doesn‚Äôt looks good.. for normal use it‚Äôs ok.. but those who are heavy user for them doesn‚Äôt look good....Very handy phone with a premium look... but the bazzels one the screen looks old.. but overall it‚Äôs good to buy within this price rangeREAD MORE
This phone is meant for niche market. Not for people who like screen size more than 5.5 or 6 inch. Was waiting for a product like this since long and now will experience this with the latest A13 bionic chip. Great buy for people who require smaller handy phones. Not for gaming purpose of course. You can buy a play station instead üòâ. RegardsREAD MORE

"The performance iss as expected great, the battery life is not actually a concern, but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww. Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager, with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20% left and you could get near to 80 ,.

The Apple IPhone SE has been an all time favorite for the family members due to its size and quality. I have been using the old model of SE from 2014 and now changed to 2020 SE model due to its quality and reliability.

Amazing CameraSpeaker is just too good.The fluidic interface of apple which feels so smooth while using it.The earphones given along with mobile phone in-box is just superb. Cons.1.

Although with normal usage, my phone lasts ...READ MORE"
"I bought this mobile as a replacement for my mother's age old iphone 5S, as she was stuck with IOS & single home button. I'm really surprised with its great performance and features. Felt like buying it for myself too. But its battery is not so great for working people. To sum it up, very good mobile for this price bracket.READ MORE"
"Battery backup is good, using it for last 2 weeks and it works for 24 hours for me in moderate usage. Camera is better than most of high end Android phones.

In a market where thick heavy and monster sized smartphones are ubiquitous, this is a life saver for people like me who just want a thin and light smartphone that‚Äôs also easy to hold with one hand without compromising on performance.
