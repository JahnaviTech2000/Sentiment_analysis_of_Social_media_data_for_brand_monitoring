GSM Arena quote 'Hybrid zoom whatever that means'. Other phones have had this feature with a combination of optical and digital and you have mentioned it before. So what's so confusing about it on here?? You know full well what it is 
"i'd rather get a mi 11 ultra than this thing.
 
the cameras are great, although i'd prefer a much higher magnification, such as 5x or 10x.
 
the microscope is a very big gimmick, and shall never be put on a flagship that costs twice than a student's debt.
 
overall, a mi 11 ultra is much better option, or even a vivo x60 pro+ which also has a better 5x magnification. 
pairing either of those devices with gcam, then you have a pocket dslr which costs $2000 less."

"After 3 months , we can really see which company can make the flagship phones people love and the sales speak in favour of Apple iPhone 
I don't know why most people are against the truth , it's not easy to make and sell flagship phones actually most companies just make but don't sell but when it comes to Apple"

"battery life is weird
 
other website said it's ok et some that's it's better compare to X2 pro. something's wrong I think"
"With all the praise of oled being better for battery life , this one sucks real bad
 
I thought oled was so superior that it would always compensate for bad optimisation especially this A+ rating  5z to 120hz , 10 bit color GOD level AMOLED"

"Anonymous, 18 Mar 2021It frankly feels like a downgrade on paper. 
It has downgraded internal storage from 512gb to... moreThat too, same price less storage, lower camera specs and poor battery life - no thanks OPPO."
"i0S.-.Never.-.Again, 18 Mar 2021What the heck Oppo???

New generation LTPO display dimmer than last year.

New generation ... morePretty much what I thought..."
"1) I really liked the camera, very natural looking shots! I also wish they had a 3x though. 2) Disappointing battery. 3) The Mi 11 costs 899 in Europe, not 750!"

"Rudy, 18 Mar 2021I can't speak for others, but the rear design is UGLYit looks like a tumor:)"
Hello OnePlus 9 pro 
Great but the battery endurance

My ONLY complain will be the selfie camera looks like they used the x2pro's selfie which is years behind the best selfies. How I know? I Got x2pro. Am I still upgrading to x3pro? Yes. 
I stopped reading when the battery life rating was 80 odd hours. Very poor. Phones need minimum 5000mah these days. 
"TECH--BEAST, 18 Mar 2021Ugly design ...stupid screen.... poor battery LIFE .... and bad selfie camera ... BIG BIG FAIL!!!I can only agree on the battery life, everything else is top notch."
"Wonder if find x3 cameras will perform the same as find x3 pro ...
 
I have limited budget... Between find x3 , rog 5 or iqoo 7 ... All in same price bracket with their own advantages.
 
Still waiting for oneplus 9 and huawei p50."

New generation LTPO display dimmer than last year.

New generation ... moreIt frankly feels like a downgrade on paper.  
It has downgraded internal storage from 512gb to 256gb while keeping the same price for base variant.  
Another downgrade is the Gorilla Glass 5 on the X3 pro vs the Gorilla Glass 6 on the Find X2 pro.

The night pictures are very good but frankly I am still more impressed by the one captured by the Omnivision sensor from last year Xiaomi  MI 10 ultra. 
"What the heck Oppo???
 
New generation LTPO display dimmer than last year.
 
New generation Snapdragon 888 scoring same as last year's Snapdragon 865.
 
Newer generation phone with efficient 5nm chip and LTPO display giving worse battery life than last year. 
 
Newer generation phone trading premium looks of vegan leather back and gold accents for ugly gas burner design like iPhone. 
 
Newer generation phone trading useful 5x Periscope for 2x optical zoom and micro Camera.

photo 121/184 is imo the best night shot in a phone
"Alex, 18 Mar 2021Cameras are unusable at night. That's what you get for using those tiny 50MPs instead of ... moreI'm with you Alex.  Not liking the nighttime photos at all.  They may capture scenes as the eye sees (as the review mentions), but I much prefer some processing that brightens some of the dark areas to bring out more detail even if it's not technically more realistic."
"It's a really nice phone but the price is wrong. It costs the same like iPhone 12 Pro and Galaxy S21 Ultra. No way I'd choose Oppo, sorry."
"Mike9625, 18 Mar 2021He did not read the article, neither he saw the pictures. I'm really impressed by how the... morei agree, its up there with Pixel's Night Sight and iPhone's Night Mode. this is the best phone of 2021 imo"

"im sold, this is going to be my next phone, best part is it will work in the US as long as i pay attention to the 4G/5G bands in carriers. ColorOS IS AWSOME, cameras are outstanding, battery is more than enough for me (as per my usage), screen size is perfect, it has GMS. This is my ideal phone!
 
Awsome job Oppo!!!!!"

"sohail shafayat, 18 Mar 2021Very consistent in poor battery lifeI like  it"

Interested in Oppo Find X3 Pro ( Mobile Phone) 
"Love it, but dang..  that battery life really sucks!"
"Wow, the microscope shot of an human skim with thr hair detail. Impressive. "
"According to the Android Authority, only charger made by Oppo is gonna work at 65W.  
Any charger for another brand (no matter if it is 65 too) is gonna work 10W on this phone. 

"
"Alex, 18 Mar 2021Cameras are unusable at night. That's what you get for using those tiny 50MPs instead of ... moreMost of the photos are above ISO2000.  
Even a Micro 4/3 would struggle. Let alone the phone. 
 
You should not expect similar performance you seen from photos taken at ISO600 or less.  
At this high ISO, the iphone and galaxy would do way worse. 

"
Very consistent in poor battery life
"Cameras are unusable at night. That's what you get for using those tiny 50MPs instead of regular 12MPs. And Oppo doesn't have intelligence to write good algorithms to tune it up, even for the Night Mode."
No periscope is a step back. How did they even consider this stupid decision?
"Anonymous, 18 Mar 2021I wonder whats going on with the SD888 and why so many phones with it are performing on par or... moreprobably because of Samsung's 5nm process, which causes it to have less performance, and whenever you see a phone with it that gets 710,000+ on antutu, it means, they paid them or cheating by using their full performance.
 
also from what i've heard, phone's with 888 usually overheat, just like the snapdragon 820, as they have the same node."
I wonder whats going on with the SD888 and why so many phones with it are performing on par or just a little better at best than last years SD865. Normally with each new snapdragon the difference will be pretty big.
Remember how Xperia 1II battery test was disappointing with only 83 hours and everyone was blaming it on a small 4000mah capacity and 4K screen? Enter 2021 with both Chinese flagships hitting barely the same number but with 4500mah plus capacity.
"Oppo really took some weird decisions with this generation , it is upgrade in some areas and downgrade in others screen is great but LTPO is supposed to be the main upgrade over its predecessor yet no true adaptive high refresh rate so no impact in battery life which is garbage just like mi11 even though size is kinda big and camera is fantastic it really delivered like oppo said aside from that mediocre telephoto , for microscope i think it is cool but would prefer  periscope as it is much useful  
If they kept same design as last year along with same camera setup along with much better battery life , it would be perfect device"
"Dometalican, 18 Mar 2021While the camera looks REALLY good (Periscope would have been icing on the cake), that battery... moreYeah, wonder if the find x3 with the snapdragon 870 would be much different battery wise"
the photos from this phone is pretty good. but i really want gsmarena to release a review of the vivo x60 pro+ and have a shootout between the distant families of the bbk company.
"While the camera looks REALLY good (Periscope would have been icing on the cake), that battery life is insanely disappointing. LTPO panel and yet Oppo took ZERO advantage over it. OnePlus is even going to impliment it better. One can only hope it's a software update away from fixing that. Otherwise, I'd skip this gen and stick with the X2 Pro despite the lack of wireless charging."
"I can't speak for others, but the rear design is UGLY"
It would be interesting if you could take a macro photo of a ruler. Then we can see how big the magnification really is.
