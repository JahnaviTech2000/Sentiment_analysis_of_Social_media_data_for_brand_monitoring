"This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone. Best features with stunning looks & performance. Battery life is very good...READ MORE"
This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I‚Äôve been a long time android user in between. I‚Äôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...READ MORE
"Totally worth the price if:- you are a iOS fan- like compact phone- want to switch from android to iPhone- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (yo...READ MORE"
Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.

"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.READ MORE"

"People talk about it‚Äôs battery backup?? man I‚Äôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you‚Äôve used both you‚Äôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.READ MORE"
"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it.

"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE"

"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with...READ MORE"
"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand.

"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11.READ MORE"
"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11.READ MORE"
"Camera- 4.5/5 (However if it had dedicated night mode i will give it 5 out of 5)Performance- 5/5 (A13 Bionic chip is powerful enough to handle any kind of task)Display- 4/5 (Super color accurate display, but if it have 800 nits of brightness then it will get 5)Battery- 2.5/5 (Battery is the weakest point of this phone. Although the standby time is great but in very light use i get 4.5 Hours of SOT)Software- 5/5 (Since it is a apple device so you will get ios updates for long period of tim...READ MORE"
"After 2 days of usage!!It‚Äôs a beast!! May it be performance or camera or sound quality, it‚Äôs a total beast at its price. üî•It degrades every mid tier mobile.Battery maybe a drawback for some, but according it‚Äôs an excellent daily drive mobile. Normal usage would give a nice battery life.Power bank is proffered to be kept in hand for some. Camera is exceptionalüëåüèΩI don‚Äôt find any cons at all, to be honest.The display size is small, yeah. But it‚Äôs so cute and handy to use. And it‚Äôs les...READ MORE"
"The best budget iPhone you can get. The camera: great for daylight images, only downside I would say is the lack of night sight, but yeah it does the task. Performance: I will certainly be joking if I said I was experiencing issues with the phone‚Äôs performance. It‚Äôs A13 for god‚Äôs sake. The best processor in the market right now and I feel this is the reason most of us are buying. This phone is gonna last you more than any android in the same price segment will ever do. And that includes One...READ MORE"

"If you don't know the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, this is the phone to introduce you to it and if you use it properly, you will never go backIt's (comparatively) reasonably priced. In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most ""cheaper"" phones out there.The camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect. Cons - battery isn't as ...READ MORE"
"It‚Äôs a beast in performance, only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn‚Äôt break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I‚Äôve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if...READ MORE"
"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don‚Äôt expect great pics in night. Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess v...READ MORE"
"This is one of the best mobile. Since I‚Äôm using this phone from last 24 hours and I personally feel that it‚Äôs a complete packet. It contains everything, yes its display is bit smaller but you don‚Äôt feel if you are comfortable with small phones. The A13 chip set is playing its best role. I personally feel that it‚Äôs good for normal person. Not for heavy gamers.READ MORE"
