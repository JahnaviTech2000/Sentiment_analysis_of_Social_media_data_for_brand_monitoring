"Hi all, I want to buy a pixel 5 but never used android coming from iOS but love the size and spec however, I notice that most shops are completely out! Is it because there are problems with this device? Has it been recalled? Sorry for asking but wanted to double check as the 4a is still available in all shops. I’d be grateful if someone knows or could let me know if they have had any experience. Thank you in advance "

"Google also needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced. Night Sight takes up to approximately 6.5 seconds (without counting the processing time) (proof: see Engadget's Pixel 5 youtube review at 11:45 , I have measured the duration), by the way, that's also the case with the Pixel 3a. 
HDR+ enhanced is a fast Night Sight mode and only takes up to 2.5 seconds, if you don't zoom. Instead of an exposure time of 1/2-1s per frame, it chooses 1/5s per frame, so you get nearly always sharp photos with HDR+ enhanced whereas Night Sight often leads to slightly blurry = worse photos or you need to take the photo again, then it's basically 13s vs 2.5s (actually even more than 2x6.5s=13s because you have to check whether the image is blurry). So Google really needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced, which can nearly always produce as bright photos as Night Sight, if you use exposure compensation. Apple's night mode only takes 1-3s."
"I hope that when the Pixel 6 is released, Google finally stops to spread lies. When the Pixel 3 was released, they said that their super resolution zoom was comparable with 2x optical zoom. It was a lie. In perfect light conditions without shadows it's even not as good as 1.1x optical zoom because there is basically no advantage at all (I have a Pixel 3a). 
When the Pixel 4 was released, they said that their zoom was comparable with 3x optical zoom. Again a lie. One can even show (mathematically and based on tests with Bayer cameras) that due to diffraction, that's physically impossible, if ""optical zoom"" is meant to be a sharp optical zoom."
The dual sim (with e-sim) would be preferred

"Help I have been going crazy the last few days youtubing googling night and day.  I currently have the huawei p20 pro which in good lighting takes very good pics.  Now I love the pics im seeing from the pixel 5: the depth and contrast of colours.(I did notice the selfie is a abit of a let down compared to its rear camera. However from looking at video's of pixel look 50/50 some look grainy/and loss of quality.  I do take pics more, but I still want the option to take good videos too.  Now i did narrow my choice to pixel 5 vs iphone 12pro.  i prefer pics taken by pixel but videos am i going to regret having poor quality videos?? or can the pixel match the iphone. Im tired of youtubing there's so many reviews that are blantenly biased.  Now to confuse things furthermore i don't mind considering the oppo x2find pro.  
I'm after a wow camera if there is a thing i mainly take pics of the kids and my cat (if that helps)-with google play services.  Out of the three I have mentioned has anyone outthere tested all 3?  
It don't help during lockdown that I cant go out and test a handet.   
Any suggestions will be appreciated!"

Expandable storage? No Pixel had ever had it. Honestly microSD cards are slow and prone to failure. Last time I used one was with my S5 which had 16GB storage. 
 
And you want a bigger battery? Pixel 5 had the biggest battery of any pixel and as a heavy user I'm happy with the battery life / size weight of the device.
 
Some people just want miracles and no matter what they put in a phone, someone will always want more and for a lower price. If anything I would say they got the features right, would be nice if they spent a bit more on build quality and refinement. "

"Anonymous, 09 Nov 2020Bro, you use your phone to browse porn and Tiktok, why do you act like you need anything flags... moreWe are seeing the beginning of a trend change. 
Just like desktops did, phones will start to diverge in processing power as per user needs. 
We started seeing the ""G"" branded processors, and soon that would extend to things beyond a boost in GPU clock speed: 
Think of having an Intel i7 with a integrated graphics and Intel i7 with a discrete RTX3080. 
Both are flagship chipsets, but gaming on them (for those requiring it) is a night-and-day difference. System price is quite different as well. 
Today, the SD765 is closer to an i5 with a 1050Ti, for example, and the SD865 is an i7 with RTX3080...  
Can you really say that everyone needs an i7 with RTX3080? I don't think so 
Can you not play pretty much every game out there on an i5 with GTC 1050i? of you course you could at various degrees of resolution/quality degradations.
 
Also, are there not premium laptops with i5s? sure thing 
And thus, we are now heading into this trend, and I guess we will start seeing SD8x5 and SD8x5G processors as well as SD7x5 and SD 7x5G processors powering up phones, probably even the same phone model with just the processor/memory variations.
 
Apple so far is doing the opposite with keeping the same flagship chipset and downgrading the design on its various tiers, but that too I believe will soon change; but Apple will always be Apple, they will do whatever they feel like waking up in the morning and everybody will applaud and follow :D

"My favorite feature of the Google Pixel device is its look. Other than that, I am not sure about the performance."
"Don't forget the suprise of 2020: the Xperia 5 ii. If have this phone for two weeks now and it ticks all the boxes. 120hz refresh rate, oled display, good camera, wide angle and zoom lens, dedicated pro camera settings like their pro camera line up, 3.5 mm jack, no punch or notch, fingerprint reader is integrated in onoff button like an airpad, 5g of course, 128gb and expandable to 1tb, Dolby Atmos, enhanced gaming experience and Snapdragon 865 / 8 RAM, and a sturdy build quality with no plastics (glass and aluminium). Not one phone on the market has this combo (that I know of). Maybe the S20 comes close but in Europe it has an exynos processor, and it lacks a 3.5 jack. The only thing it's lacking is a wireless charging option, but I personally don't care for that. All in all, the most complete phone on the market right now?"
"Take a look at the iphone 12 mini and the Pixel 5. Like come'on google. The iphone has a the fastest chip, better cameras, better screen, better water proofing and mag safe.

What on earth are you even saying? Exynos 990, despite its spotty reputation, is still powerful enough to absolutely annihilate SD765G in every single way you could imagine. It's nearly 40% faster under multi-threaded workload and packs double the graphics performance. All right, 765G is more battery friendly, sure - but that's due to the simple fact that it's FAR less powerful having 2 less performance cores that are also clocked lower than those on Exynos 990. You just can't say a midrange SoC is more powerful than a high end SoC, end of story.
 
""pixel 5 still creates beter photos by software"" 
It depends on scenes though I do agree that Pixel 5 has an upper hand in general.
 
""iphone 12.. but is also 100-200$ more expensive"" 
Well that's an extra money you should be paying for the most performant phone SoC to date, one of the highest water resistance rating (6m for 30 mins) you can get on a phone, and possibly a more durable body, a higher quality display and better sounding speakers.
 
""you only get a plastic back"" 
I mean, you're only touching the thick plastic layer when you hold Pixel 5 as well, so..
 
""most phones will operate in 60hz anyways to save battery"" 
""No game right now runs on more than 60hz on android"" 
So not true, but it's up to you whether you want to hold onto that belief."

"About the battery test... wasn't the web browser test done in 90hz then? I understand if the video test ends up in 60hz and the call time... well, I guess the display isn't even on then."
"Anonymous, 27 Oct 2020No, the Chinese flagships do not have a better color balance.  Just look at the grass shots in... moreSome Chinese high end phones still have a comparable texture rendition to Pixel during the day and usually a lot better at night because of the large sensor size (unless you use Night Sight on Pixel). Google's mix of aggressive contrast enhancement and dehaze filter in the post processing has never been my cup of tea, and they certainly managed to make it a lot more artificial than back in Nexus 6P/OG Pixel era.. Good lord that they added the option to shoot in RAW. There is still a room for improvements in the way Oppo/Vivo/OnePlus handles the images, but Xiaomi is getting there and Huawei is definitely the best in terms of the detail rendering/noise reduction, though the digital crop they apply by default hurts the per-pixel sharpness quite a bit. As for colours, you can turn off the AI to make it look a lot more natural, as I already said before.
 
iPhones have nice colours (if a bit too cold and greenish in many scenario) and their night mode is easily one of the best, but the amount of compression, sharpening and local contrast boost they apply during the day are hilariously excessive and on top of that photos still look like they have come out of a small sensor like those from Pixel. As far as I could tell I don't see a whole lot of difference between 12 Pro and 11 Pro, but I guess the situation would be slightly better on 12 Pro Max that comes with the brand new 1/1.7"" sensor."

"Anonymous, 27 Oct 2020I'm not on par with your ""alternatives""! 

Also does the Oneplus Nord have mo... moreMy man spitted facts right there ngl, Im gonna buy one when price drops"
"I'm not on par with your ""alternatives""! 
 
Also does the Oneplus Nord have more cameras, BUT yet NO Telephoto lense! You only get a telephoto lense + ultrawide + wide in the Samsung S20FE, which misses out the 5G and comes with a worse SOC at 600$ (the pixel 5 is 600$ outside the US because of the mmwave technology!)! 
Both the Nord and the FE been tested average, the nord even below average when it comes to photo quality (even if it offers a better main camera on paper). When comparing the OP 8t you also DONT get a telephoto lense and an ultra-wide with 16mp like the pixel 5 one. The OP8t with 5g is 50-100$ more expensive than the pixel 5 (matter of location). Though you get higher MP in the main camera, if you are up for that (pixel 5 still creates beter photos by software). The Nord also misses out on the Qi-charging front and has no USB 3.0 or 3.1, has gorilla glass 5 instead of 6, is made of plastic, BUT has an ultra-wide front cam.
 
You DON'T get more when choosing 400$ phones. Most phones at 400$, fake around their cameras. They are often below average but always don't offer more combinations than wide and Ultrawide, just like the Pixel 5. There is no need for 2MP Macro-Cameras or depth-cameras. Most 400$ phones offer 5g only when spending 100$ more (cept the Nord, which I already stated has bad cameras).
 
The only real alternative to the pixel 5 is the iphone 12 which is near the same size with 6,1"", better video qualities, Face unlock, mag safe accessoires, etc., but is also 100-200$ more expensive and YET does NOT offer a telephoto lense! Also the s20 FE is a true android alternative. Its also the only phone offering wide, ultrawide and telephoto in one phone sub 800$, but is much larger with 6,5"" AND it also plays around with prices. You won't get an SD865 (none +) and no 5g for 700$ - but only 4G and an much unloved Exynos chipset. And you only get a plastic back in the 700 and 800$ version.
 
Conclusion: Google packed its 5 with everything to expect from a phone sub 800$ (700$ inside US, 620$ outside US): 90hz, 5g, wireless charging, USB 3.1, bezelless design (not even a chin!), ultrawide/wide camera setup which is still one of the best, still the best night-mode, finally 4k videso at 60hz, 8GB RAM, no plastic back. Still it misses out on the front camera and the ROM offered. The missing 120hz and 6,5"" is up to you guys, most phones will operate in 60hz anyways to save battery. No game right now runs on more than 60hz on android.
 
I know why I bought the pixel 5. Google finally done most thigs right!

IMHO Xperia 5 II is an excellent device - it takes incredible photos when you use proper app and settings, but I am fed up with Sony software bugs. I hope Xperia 5 II wins me back over time, so next year Xperia 5 III will be one of my candidates.

- Cheaper
 
Wide-angle cam and maintaining a small size is just gravy. Google went back to the basics. I already own the 3 which has a stronger GPU, so I don't need it.

Could be a good phone but batterylife. I own a m51 and even that battery life is just sufficient.  Get about 1.5 days. And half the price of this pixel phone.

Nexus 5x in HDR+ On mode definitely takes sharper photos and is probably still the reference for daylight image quality. See anandtech's Nexus 5x camera review, the Nexus 5x camera (better daylight results than Pixel 3a, which I own, too) isn't very known because the default mode wasn't HDR+ On as a zero shutter lag HDR+ didn't exist back then. In the last years Google didn't find ways to improve the fantastic HDR+ daylight quality, but apparently they thought that they must change something, so things got worse, I guess that meanwhile the wrong people make the decisions and that's very critical as it's a matter of taste (and not science) whether a camera company wants to apply more noise reduction, "
"Surprised that Google chose a low quality ultra wide angle lens. I much prefer a tele lens, but then even just a low quality ultra wide angle? Ok, Apple uses a very bad ultra wide angle lens, too , but that's Apple's problem and I guess that Apple's ultra wide angle lens is sharper. The Pixel 4 already had a 21.5mm ultra wide angle camera, it was the selfie camera. It delivered decent results when it was used as a rear camera. Now they have a dedicated rear camera for ultra wide angle photos, but the quality is probably not really better than using the ultra wide selfie camera of the Pixel 4. So it's really a step back. Pixel 4 had ultra wide(if you used the selfie camera as a rear camera, it also supported Night Sight as far as I know) + 50mm + main camera."

The fantastic image quality of the Nexus 5x in HDR+ On mode was ignored by several reviewers as this wasn't the default mode because HDR+ could take up to 1s and back then Google had the philosophy that the default mode must be fast. In 2015/2016, if you took 3 HDR+ photos, you had to wait some seconds before you could take another HDR+ photo. But the quality of the default mode was much, much worse in all light conditions. From what I have seen, Google hasn't improved the daylight image quality since the Nexus 5x HDR+ On mode, rather worse. I also have a Pixel 3a, which produces worse daylight photos than the Nexus 5x."

"Socalteknique, 26 Oct 2020How come Gsmarena doesn't take pictures of the usual buildings like in other phone review... moreYes, it's strange. Whenever a new Pixel phone is released, the camera is reviewed by someone else. This was already the case with the Pixel 4 and Pixel 3a."
"I have the impression that Google's camera got worse in daylight. In good light conditions it seems to use more noise reduction than every Google phone of the last 5 years. Nexus 5x HDR+ photos look much sharper. A reviewer showed that the Pixel 4 takes sharper photos than the Pixel 5. As the Pixel 5 is Google's first Pixel phone that combines different exposures, there can be less exposures available for the brightest parts of the image (sky, etc, previously Google only combined underexposed images), that's maybe the reason for the increase in noise reduction."

It’s too expensive for this price. Don’t know what Google was thinking. Looks like a half heartedly done job. A phone launched just for the sake of it. Galaxy S20 appears a better package hands down. Pixel 5 should be a below $500 phone. 
"It's big as my Pixel 1 that had 5"" screen ;) 
Idle battery life so far is great, good sound when taking call (a bit ""bassy"" due to the speaker being behind glass), it charges slowly when not using PD charger and the camera is good - especially when I am taking pics of my dog that is black (on a Pixel you can see fur, on Xperia it was just underexposed black painting no matter what I did ... well the only thing that fixed it was to turn on flashlight).  
I switched stereo speakers, dedicated camera button and faster SOC Xperia to Pixel, and I am perfectly OK with it, because the phone was not yet able to frustrate me as Sony often did.
 
So IMHO a good phone, not exceptional value or anything like my Realme 6 I use for work is, but the Bose headphones I will receive, will make it into even sweeter experience.
 
If they finally ditch the ancient camera sensors next year, I will be seriously interested in upgrading to Pixel 6. "

"The photos look absolutely stunning let be honest.  IMX 363 might be old, but as Marc Levoy pointed out there has been no pivotal changes in sensor tech only incremental ones.  Camera is all about the software, in the Pixel 5 photos I see consistency.  Exposure, details, white balance and low light are the best I have seen.  Sure there are advantages to have a bigger sensor but there are also disadvantages like focusing.  Google has dramatically improved the battery life and video quality this year which is a big win for us.  "

"As others have said, nothing special. It's weird that it feels like the 4a 5G would tick more boxes for someone who wants the basics (stereo speakers, headphone jack, dual cam, and solid-enough battery).
 
Google's going in the right direction. If they want to succeed next year, they should do:
 
Pixel 5a with Snapdragon 690 (makes no sense to give it the same processor as the 'flagship') 
Pixel 6 with a 775 and 6.0"" display 
Pixel 6 XL with the same as above but with a 6.7"" display
 
But the 'flagships' need to come with 3 cameras, some bezel to house dual selfie cams again, FRONT-FACING stereo speakers, and the return of unlimited cloud photos storage. Make them come with all that while pricing it well and I can see Pixel finally bringing in some solid devices."
I would really like that staff from GSMarena take pictures from standard locations from where they take pictures with all other smartphones. This way we really can not compare them side by side with Pixel device. Otherwise good and objective review as always.
"Ok so.   
This particular phone is wanted for two things : Stock experience and Camera. 
So i have 2 questions for GSMarena crew: 
1) Why Pixel shots in general are in a Different location? Presumably outside Europe (Following the vivid atmosphere there) 
- Other devices like Xiaomi's or Onepluses/ Samsungs are i believe in Sofia (Bulgaria) so we can easily compare ourselves with our amateur or proficient knowledge of photography? 
2) Why there is always an underline or a biased text when reviewing a Pixel or a Google phone of the late era towards IN A NEGATIVE WAY?  
-The Subtle ""Never settle"" shirt, passively aggressive |not being impressed by anything that this device offers"" which happened way to many times in recent years.
 
Pixel 5 is a Great phone, i mean great.  
Form factor, Simplicity, Saves time and money and will be More consistent and  More secure By A MILE then other android device.  
And You should emphasize that. That isn't a small feat. 
Improving software is important. Same or more then hardware."

"Where's the audio test and performance? Just saying in summary ""loud speakers"" doesn't give much away. Come on GSMArena.  
Under screen speaker doesn't fill me with confidence at all! "
What's strange is that the 16 megapixel ultra wide angle photos are saved as 12 megapixel jpgs. Would be interesting to know the resolution of the ultra wide dng files.
"Google hasn't brought back the white balance presets, very poor decision. More than 240 support forum users voted for the white balance presets. They simply don't listen to feedback at all. 
Google hasn't brought back HDR+ enhanced, more than 170 support forum users voted for bringing back HDR+ options. HDR+ enhanced is better than Night Sight. When you use it with exposure compensation, it is nothing else than a fast Night Sight mode. While Night Sight takes up to 7s in extreme low-light conditions, HDR+ enhanced takes up to 2.5s (or 4s if you zoom), which is more similar to Apple's night mode, which takes up to 3s by default. Night Sight also often leads to slightly blurry photos, if you don't stop breathing for 7 seconds, that's another reason why HDR+ enhanced is much better.
 
It's disappointing that there is still no periscope camera and that they even replaced tele with an ultra wide angle camera, which doesn't even have autofocus for macro photos. 
Apparently you can still not edit HDR+ raw files with the Google Photos app. As far as I know Apple's photo app will support editing raw files.
 
And of course very disappointing that they still use the Imx 363, which suffers extremely from dead pixels (tested with multiple Pixel 3a) that can not be removed with 3rd party software as Google's image processing transforms the dead pixels."
Good phone but where is the sound review ? 
"""Since there's no longer a telephoto camera on the Pixel 5 and the ultra-wide doesn't feature an autofocus lens, the main camera no longer has this second eye to distinguish depth"" 
I doubt that the missing autofocus is relevant for non-macro photos. Such ultra wide angle cameras have a very high depth of field, so they don't need autofocus for sharp photos unless you want to take macro (portrait) photos."
"Google is doing fine with their phones. Some people may think Google is a bit behind in the cellphone game but this is the best 5th generation phone compared to all other companies previous release of their ""5"" model.  "

"I think the Pixel 5 is a solid phone. The price is friendly coupled with the IP rated smaller form factor. I do wish it was available in more countries. I also agree that the hardware would need a major upgrade. Let's see the Pixel 5a/6 next year hopefully.

I am coming from a pixel 2xl and struggling to decide which phone to get.
 
I love Pixel phones, simplicity and all of the Google features. Yet I love to edit video on my phone, easier for me that way. I can do so on my pixel 2xl, but it is showing its age. Wondering how the 765 can handle that sort of stuff. 
 
I am tempted by the note 20 ultra, plenty of room to edit and shoot videos, but is the camera as good? And it's also so expensive.
 
One plus 8 pro is a good compromise in price, but the camera is not as good? Or on par?
 
Just wish there was an XL version of the Pixel 5 or a Pixel 5+ version with all the specs. "
"or even better sony 5 II, much better having a bezel than holes on the screen.. but it is missing wireless charging... :((("
"Anonymous, 25 Oct 2020I actually quite like this phone and it's the first Pixel phone I like.  

It has a mod... moreAgree. First time I'm considering a Pixel. But probably 4a 5G seems like a slightly better deal for 499."
"It seems like Google somewhat mitigated the issue from Pixel 4 where tons of noises are introduced to shadows and the corners when scenes have a wide dynamic range, even at the base ISO. I still find the output from Pixel 5 a bit too noisy and fuzzy for my liking, though.
 
Google should use a larger sensor for the next gen. product and bring telephoto lens back, otherwise Pixel lineup will lose all the advantages they had in camera department over its rivals for years. The competition has caught up and is surpassing it right now while Google is still stumbling with stupid hardware decisions, they seriously need to get their **** together."
Good phone but where is the sound review ? 
"Shriker, 25 Oct 2020""The level of resolved detail is generally good"". Not sure what photos the reviewer ... moreMi 10 Pro/Ultra, Galaxy S20 (in 64MP mode), Mate 30/P40 Pro, Mate 40 Pro+, etc.. To be honest it's not really hard for me to list them out. Pixel 5 does capture a lot of details for using such an inferiour set of hardware, but I've already seen many phones with significantly larger sensors outperforming it especially when it comes to texture retention and noiselessness."
noting special
The only thing I like about this phone is ugly yet minimalist design 
"Anonymous, 25 Oct 2020I actually quite like this phone and it's the first Pixel phone I like.  

It has a mod... morepunch hole is even worse than notch lol. and on p5 you can't even hide it.. on other phones like s20fe or op 8t you can hide it, think ill skip p5 and go for one of those.."
I don't think lack of headphone jack is a problem with phones besides why do you need an headphone jack where wireless connectivity is ruling
Nice phone but I don't like too much Google services
"I actually quite like this phone and it's the first Pixel phone I like.  
 
It has a modern design, nice display without large top bezel or hideous notch, decent battery life, sturdy build (not likely to break if I drop it), decent cameras, fast charging, wireless charging, decent processor, 5G and a fingerprint scanner (yes, you need it when you're out and about with a mask on).  And the price is not too bad.  
 
I actually think Google should just keep making these midrange phones and stop competing in the flagship space where they're being outcompeted in every way.  And if they do, they should think about getting rid of the lower tier ""a"" phones.  They don't really need another set of midrangers."
"Google should fire all cylinders and go full steam with high end phones irrespective of their sales. If they could deliver highend phones consistently every year with great camera, sure one day or the other it will be in the same league of iphones. Already pixels have a great software, the only thing stopping it in achieveing greatness is Googles inconsistent attitude. 
General Pixel cons are: 
Lack of headphone jack 
No FM Radio 
Compromise on Camera lens (this is INEXCUSABLE) 
Poor battery life 
Lack of S-pen like feature. "
Can you remove the Google search bar from the home screen?
"Missing headphones jack, SD card support are not considered as cons anymore? "
"Shriker, 25 Oct 2020""The level of resolved detail is generally good"". Not sure what photos the reviewer ... moreEasy trick. 
 
Boost colour contrast and details are easier to see.  
Exactly what Google has done since Pixel 1.  
Also apply tons of sharpening. "
"I'm in love with this device. I want to buy, but my country IDN only allow registered IMEI of device to use local network providers, google did not sell any phone in my country. "
"For the first time I skip new Pixels having had all previous models before (except budget 3a). $700 for THIS is damn too much Google, sorry. I'll probably take my old Pixel 3 (the best Pixel phone to my opinion) out of the drawer and start using it again rather than buy P5."
"""The level of resolved detail is generally good"". Not sure what photos the reviewer is looking at but, the ones in the review are outstanding and i challenge the author to find another phonecam that can take such detailed shots like that, consistently across the full frame, even if using manually downscaled 64/108mp images."
Pixel 4 = better design
