"Anonymous, 01 Jul 2021The name Hasselbad sounds old fashioned and shit to make it worse they spent 150 million on th... moreHasselblad was traditionally famous for several things. One was the difficulty of loading film into the backs. Another was the price of the lenses. And the third was that they survived being dropped three feet, essential with cameras popular with wedding photographers. 
Colour profiles in those days depended on the film you used and how it was developed. Nothing to do with Hasselblad at all. 
Leitz at least had experience with microscope lenses and bought Minox so they knew how to do phone cameras. But many Hasselblad lenses were Zeiss. 
Thank you for letting me get that out. Just the travesty of the Hasselblad name would stop me buying a OnePlus."

The name Hasselbad sounds old fashioned and shit to make it worse they spent 150 million on that brand which is not as good as Apple and Samsung+they print the name on there phone

"Battery drainer, 06 Jun 2021Battery life is terrible. 86h!True, but the 30 minute charge time compensates for it.

"Pine Green color is muted and is not slick at all which is quite nice, but highly recommend a case.  Screen protectors don't seem to allow fingerprint access  The OS has a mind of its own changing second screen profile.  I wanted to like this model, since the Nord 10g 5G it is supposed to replace is really nice. This one has turned out to be very disappointing.  It had been initially advertised as Dual Sim but ships single sim capable.  Probably the worst battery life of any phone I've had.  I have requested return authorization, but Customer Service has failed to provide the free return label, instead sending me a link to a British website that doesn't accept U.S. data to create a label.  Not a good ""upgrade"" from less inexpensive models.

Expect to see a battery size increase for future models otherwise I may just get a gaming phone next time as the thing I love on the OP8 is the battery while gaming. The 9R could be the smart buy but oneplus 7 users with the periscope camera still have no full screen oneplus device to upgrade to, OP8 users have no reason to upgrade either seeing as the battery lasts longer than the 0P9 and has better thermal handling than the snapdragon 888. I think oneplus is trying too hard to copy Samsung. Basically Samsung buyers aren't going to switch especially seeing as oneplus no longer has a price advantage over them and the loyal oneplus users don't want a mainstream device..

I absolutely love the 6.78 inch screen which makes gaming and watching videos for me much better. This was my first oneplus phone and I love it so much I consider it my best friend. 
 
Anyways, I was obviously very curious for what the one plus 9 pro had to offer. Straight to the point, I am extremely disappointed. 4500 maH battery. How r u gonna offer the same size battery or should I say lower than the one plus 8 pro. Yes they have LTPO but I've read some reviews that say the battery life is worse than 8pro. QHD+ and a little bit better res meh. 6.7 inch screen is a downer as I wanted 6.8 as I've fallen in love with massive screens and 6.7 is smaller than the 6.78 on the 8pro. I would have probably preferred a flat screen as I get many accidental touches on my 8pro. 120hz which is the same as 8pro. 
 
Finally their camera which is supposed be the reason why the jacked up the price from what I've seen and read is still worse than iPhone 12 pro and s21 ultra cameras and maybe the mi 11. 
 
After all this I will not go and pick up a 9 pro even if I could do trade in as in my view there is nothing really compelling me to get the phone as the price has been bumped up again. If mi 11 had Google services and a good ui I would collect it.

Further, when you are focusing (justifiably) on the lack of a notable improvement in camera performance of 9 Pro - especially in light of what the competition is doing - it is difficult to understand that you list as an alternative the Mi11, which lacks a telephoto camera, without even mentioning it! This comment is not against the Mi 11 as an alternative, it is rather aimed at the lack of consistency and clarity in the tone and approach of the review.
 
Other than that, I struggle to understand OnePlus' proposition in the current smartphone landscape. It's clearly not a flagship killer approach anymore. It seems more like offering an all-round flagship that doesn't really excel at anything, but is priced as if it did. Only time will tell if this approach is sustainable, but I am not very optimistic given the alternatives at various price points around the 9 Pro's RRP. "

I first come across OnePlus brand in 2017. I bought the T3 model & have no regrets. It was a very great phone and the price tag was way below iPhone then. All those years OnePlus have gain popularity and it seems greed have overtake the company's identity of Never Settle. From a pricing of below USD 600 ( half the price of iPhone ) It now have grown to almost USD 1K. This dismay me and make me to seek other brand of same specs with a cheaper price. Hope this serve as a wake up call to the company that I once promote as an worthy underdog brand

For example a shopkeeper says to you the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is the best phone and when you try it will look very fast but only do some people know that they thing will break easily that is not a thing shopkeepers mention 
 
The point is make good phones with good quality and make it for a certain price range this is what the Pocophones are doing they will stay relevant in budget for at least 2 years then they too will turn to straight up Flagships like how OnePlus has become

Well, that's a substantial generational upgrade that unfortunately most people would struggle to notice. Honestly though dual native ISO should be nothing to do with the reason behind the noise performance, since IMX689 also had the same feature alongside 12-bit RAW capture. The improvement is probably due to better circuit optimisation, more effective cell wall shielding and such.
 
I suppose this would help a ton for GCam ports."

Samsung and Asus have more battery. the tree from BBK and xiaomi with 5000mAh for example would be able to score maybe 1h more for video and internet. 
 
** ROG obviously would score less if it had QHD. 
 
Also, the review of 21U says sometimes screen was below 60Hz. This was not noticed on Oppo. They do not know if 9P has software already to make screen go below 60Hz when there is no need of more RR. 
 
S21u would have scored more if the SD unit was tested. 
 
ROG 3 and 5 both have 144Hz.  
3 has 6,6"", while 5 has 6,8"".  
R3 wins video for 2h, but R5 wins internet by 2h.

But I a... moreI've seen people with S21U's getting well over ten hours screen on time and 2-3 days battery life. With 120Hz enabled. There's nothing wrong with either the SD888 or Exynos 2100. This seems to be a poor launch by one+. Seems like all the Chinese brands just rushed their stuff out this year."
"They just changed the making technology. 
Next year it's gonna be much better!
 
But I agree, totally not worth buying any sd888 phone. 
It's not efficient enough, which is more important than raw power these days."
And all have bashing Dxo  when 1+ didn't send the 9 series to tests. Now you have found out why. It's not in top 5
"The f number is just 1.88 according to the exif data, so rather f/1.9 lens instead of f/1.8"
"Spot on, guys. I said it before, and I'll say it again: tried and true tech will trump the latest and greatest. I'm just waiting for either a holiday sale or the S21 FE to come out so I can get an S20 FE5G at a reduced price. I'll skip this generation of SD chips, the battery draw stinks and these phones' cameras aren't all that great."
"""and 23mm equivalent f1.8 7P lens"" 
According to the exif data, the f -number is 1.88"

"That green tint on the angled photo in this review tells you all you need to know, saw the same in my 8 Pro - OnePlus uses poor quality displays dressed up with software. 
Add to that another set of poor cameras, the usual awful battery life and a bad recent record for updates and you have an overpriced waste of silicon - hard pass."
"Anonymous, 23 Mar 2021that phones have gotten extremely expensive over the years.
that's why i said you cannot... moreThey're concentrating on budget phone killers now. This is the worst time to buy a phone during the pandemic so they've played it safe with the flagships although gorilla glass 5 is way too old for this year. I wasn't happy with it on OP8"

"The snap 888 is a horrible chipset in my opinion
 
The power draw on this chipset is so horrible look at the find X3 pro, and mi 11 and the regular OnePlus 9 
 
And again EVEN with an E4 AMOLED with up to 50% better efficiency it means nothing
 
And these phones are brand new imagine how bad this hungry chipset will age this battery
 
SNAP 888 is for the trash can, better buy an 860,865, 870 phone
 
The dimensity 1200 is unproven but I'll bet it's better(efficiency wise) 
 the 888 is a joke this thing pulls almost 7W of power my god "
"Rocky420, 23 Mar 2021Looklike oneplus going down every year...because of change in leadership it losing its identity..It still destroys the galaxies in graphics even with the same chip so apart from a proper gaming phone this has to be the best non gaming phone on android "
"My buying appetite is cooled down a bit by the review, having 8 Pro, but let's not forget the practicality of superfast charging, superfast wireless charging, best rootability on the market. It does solve my problems with 8Pro such as 15W-only PD charging (I do not have Warp chargers, and respect only QC and PD), or 8 model such as no wireless charging. Despite unusal battery ranking, I doubt battery will last less than twice of Samsungs in real world, day to day, as 1+ was way ahead in models 6-7-8. Look at the massive market-topping 35hr for 3G, that's what defines the standby. My 8Pro can make it to 3rd day, and I expect 9 to go even further.
 
Performance tops the markets ex gaming phones/modes easily. No Exynos tax here. 8Pro was even excellent in not-so-popular rankings like market-topping networking performance, best UFS @3.0, fast USB etc and this got improved further.
 
Let's see how display, previously the top1-2 on the market, behaves now at night, what is the backbleeding. Will need more reviews e.g. notebookcheck.
 
Finally, I do care about weight, and it's disappointing to see no progression here (tho it's hardly any better in other flagships nowadays). 199g->197g for 6.78""->6.7"" isn't any progress, 192g for the base model isn't delightful as it doesn't solve the problem of ""i want flagship but light"" but it's nice they purposedly didn't cripple it much (as Samsung love to do e.g. Note20).
 
I'd defly upgrade from 7 models as they were not good (display very bad, network performance, UFS, USB, cameras were all semi-flagship), but it's bit harder move from 8Pro.
 
Now for the next model, as we're slightly running out of innovations, it's time for: 
- camera under display (if 1+ was first in 90Hz and fp under screen, why not this) 
- antics back.. they will have to come back: the sd card, the notif.light and the +pen (1+version of s-pen) 
-> sd card could be a smart counter-move against S21 this year -- missed opportunity! 
-> notif.light in any form must come back and it can be even a display on the back like Xiaomi/ZFlip or a glowing logo. AOD is cluttered and shows too much, there has to be a way to know 2 simple facts: charging is ON, and you got important message (SMS, Signal) worth of picking the phone. 
-> the pen or folding.. you decide!

Looklike oneplus going down every year...because of change in leadership it losing its identity..

"Same old boring OnePlus nothing changes same 256 storage, same change of charging speeds every year nothing new here no sale.
 
Plus my OnePlus7Pro is still on Android 10 today they'll never see any more money from me."
"after reading this review my advice is: ""...avoid any SD888 and better buy any SD870/SD860 chipsets..."" "
It's because Carl Pei left. Oppo is f*ccing up the good name of this brand

"Yikes! Wasn't expecting so many cons...
 
It seems it's worse overall compared to OnePlus 8 Pro. The battery life & the fourth camera in particular are noticeably worse. Don't see any real upgrades aside from the compulsory chipset upgrade & faster charging support. 
 
Oneplus needs to spend more on R&D & less on marketing..."
"Already suggested that they changed brand name to ‚ÄúOne K Plus""."
Imma keep my 3 y.o phone till i see real improvement.... hope oneplus 10 doesnt disappoint

though there are some noticeable changes, especially the design."

"I have planned to change my S20+ Exynos to OnePlus because of battery, but it seems that new Snapdragon 888 is a piece of shit in this area. It is a next phone which shows that Snapdragon 888 is bad choice if you take into account into battery, before bat score in battery area was for Xiaomi Mi 11. "
so many cons and still such a high rating. 
"Another dud.
 
Why it seems like everything except Huawei reached a plateau in their software? 
The sensors keep getting better, the lenses gets better, but the processing more often than not regresses in strange ways."
"Anonymous, 23 Mar 2021hey, at least the oneplus 9 pro was actually better than last year's.

still can't... moreit is not, the only upgrade is the chipset and storage. camera performance is worse than last years, they have not gotten rid of curved display no matter how many times we asked, it has useless cameras on the back, it was way too overhyped, it is worse overall value. it lags behind the competition, it even lags behind some upper midrange phones. that is terrible for a phone that costs $1069.
 
they don't listen to their customers like they used to back when they created the OP1..."
"Wow, I don't remember I've read such a harsh review from GSMArena in a long time.  
But why the 4.4 rating if it's so disappointing? "
"That's disappointing phone, especially camera performance. Photos from the main lens are noisy and oversharpened! OP 8 Pro photos looks much better.  
No need to but this phone, you can go for OP 8 Pro instead and it's way cheaper."
"hey, at least the oneplus 9 pro was actually better than last year's.
 
still can't forgive them for the hideous design tho. it looks worse than last year's, everybody is literally sticking to side camera module instead of centered camera modules. like the mate 40 series."
With this price tag seems to be a DOA (dead on arrival) ?
"Very interesting ...

Too suspicious ... "
Looks like a mediocre battery life is related to SD 888. Mi 11 has the same issue. So those looking for a great battery life should stay away of SD 888 devices. Previous generation of OnePlus is much beter choice in this regard. 
I think the best
"I wanna see the portrait photo taken by tele cam.

"overpriced in the name of camera... seems the $200 million will collect from customers only ,üòÇ"

That battery...is so disappointing... Wasn't kidding when I said I expected mediocrity.. 
Honestly the people involved in the camera design on this phone should all be fired. Top of the line hardware in every regard and worse image quality than from a mid-range and a good GCam build. Despicable. Had really high hopes from this. The hasselblad name means more about money than proven image quality. Bleh.
"seriously even the 9 pro is not that good?? i hope the 9R is good and if not, OnePlus is doomed...
 
even its photos are way worse than the 9 pro, the sharpening is through the roof and it looks plain disgusting. "
